Abscissa is a microframework for building Rust applications (either CLI tools
or network/web services), aiming to provide a large number of features with a
*minimal number of dependencies*, and with a *strong focus on security*.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## Features

- **command-line option parsing**: simple declarative option parser based on
  (i.e. forked from) [gumdrop]. The option parser in Abcissa contains numerous
  improvements which provide better UX and tighter integration with the other
  parts of the framework (e.g. overriding configuration settings using
  command-line options).
- **configuration**: declarative global configuration support using an `RwLock`
  on a `lazy_static`. Simple parsing of TOML configurations to serde-parsed
  global structures which can be dynamically updated at runtime.
- **error handling**: generic `Error` type based on the `failure` crate, and a
  unified error-handling subsystem.
- **logging**: uses the `log` and `simplelog` crates to automatically configure
  application-level logging, presently to standard output or files.
- **secrets management**: the (optional) `secrets` module includes a `Secret`
  type which derives serde's `Deserialize` and can be used to represent secret
  values parsed from configuration files or elsewhere (e.g. credentials loaded
  from the environment or network requests)
- **shell interactions**: support for colored terminal output (with color
  support autodetection). Useful for Cargo-like status messages with
  easy-to-use macros.
