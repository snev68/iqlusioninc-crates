High-level, (mostly) self-contained, minimalist HTTP toolkit (client-only).
Suitable for use in constrainted environments where `mio` and `tokio`
are not (yet) available.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

**gaunt.rs** is a minimalist alternative to `hyper` suitable for use in
environments where crates like `mio` and `tokio` aren't (yet) available,
such as Intel SGX or `#![no_std]` environments.

It's presently in an early stage of development and not ready for general
use, but has the following roadmap:

- Lightweight, `#![no_std]`-friendly core.
- `std`-based blocking socket I/O backend.
- `hyper`-based backend to leverage `mio`/`tokio` when available.
- Leverage `http` and `httparse` crates (`hyper` dependencies)
  as they are mature and well-tested.
- Add server support in addition to client support.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.35+
