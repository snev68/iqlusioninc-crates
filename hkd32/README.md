`hkd32` is a Rust library which implements a hierarchical deterministic
symmetric key derivation construction inspired by
[BIP-0032: Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets][bip32].

It can be used to deterministically derive a hierarchy of symmetric keys
from initial keying material through repeated applications of the
Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC).

This construction is specialized for deriving 32-byte (256-bit) keys from
an initial 32-bytes of input key material.
